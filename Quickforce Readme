What it is: A Chrome extension (Manifest V3) for Salesforce admins and developers. It adds a keyboard shortcut (Alt+S) that lets you instantly toggle between any Salesforce Lightning page and the corresponding Object Manager Setup page.

What it does:

On a record page (e.g. an Account or Contact record): opens the Object Manager Setup page for that object in a new tab
On a list view (e.g. the Accounts list): opens the Object Manager Setup page for that object in a new tab
On a Setup page: navigates back to the record/list you came from (uses sessionStorage to remember it), or falls back to Salesforce Home
On any other Lightning page: opens Setup Home
Why it exists: Salesforce admins constantly need to jump between working with records and configuring objects in Setup. Normally this means manually navigating through menus. Quickforce makes it one keyboard shortcut.

Tech details:

3 files, ~80 lines of vanilla JavaScript total, zero dependencies, no build step
manifest.json (extension config), background.js (service worker that listens for Alt+S), content.js (injected script that parses the URL and navigates)
Minimal permissions: activeTab, scripting, scoped to *.lightning.force.com only
All navigations open in a new tab
